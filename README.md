##WORK EXPERIENCE
###Data Scientist - Accenture, Gurugram
Mar-2021 - Present
Achievements/Tasks
● Leading forecasting projects & initiatives in cloud capacity planning team at a
leading tech rm, with deep learning models such as 1D causal convolutional, etc.
Conducting time-to-event analysis, classication, clustering, etc. and doing data
preparation, ensemble model training, model ranking and dashboard creation using
Power BI.
● Enhanced the performance of the demand forecasting model by optimizing deep
learning architectures and dedicated model allocation, leading to a 25% reduction
in training time and 20% reduction in operational costs through algorithmic
improvements.
● Improved the forecast accuracy of cloud resource demand by 15%, reducing
under-provisioning and over-provisioning issues, which directly contributed to a 10%
reduction in cloud infrastructure costs over the last year.
● Implemented an automated pipeline for real-time demand forecasting for
stakeholders, reducing manual effort by 30% and improving forecasting frequency
from weekly to daily updates, resulting in better resource allocation decisions.
● Established a backtesting framework for model training & performance,
implementing feedback loops to continuously ne-tune models based on new data.
This resulted in a 95% model uptime and proactive adjustments to capacity
planning based on changing workloads.
● Leveraged advanced analytics and cloud usage patterns to generate actionable
insights for stakeholders in Power BI, directly inuencing capacity expansion and
procurement strategies.
● Developing ecient methodologies of Explainable AI to detect and quantify results
of ML solutions with frameworks such as responsible-ai-toolbox, LIME, InterpretML,
etc. Deriving actionable insights as reports to be shared with Accenture & Client
Leadership.
● Implementation of real-time automated reporting system of critical issues over emails.
● Designing and Developing customized & automated dashboard for analysis and
reporting with Python & MS Power BI. Make custom connections with data
source(web scraping) and PowerBI with Python integration.
● Apply predictive analytics(Linear & Logistic Regression, Time Series Forecasting,
etc.) to provide analysis with AzureML, Sci-kit learn, etc.
● Working closely with higher management and cross-functional teams(InfoSec,
Compliance, Business, etc.) independently and proactively as part of various
projects.
